# The LearningWithNoisyLabels algorithm class for multiclass learning with
# noisy labels.
# The LearningWithNoisyLabels class wraps around an instantion of a
# classifier. Your classifier must adhere to the sklearn template,
# meaning it must define four functions:
# * clf.fit(X, y, sample_weight = None)
# * clf.predict_proba(X)
# * clf.predict(X)
# * clf.score(X, y, sample_weight = None)
# 
# where 'X' (of length n) contains your data, 'y' (of length n) contains your
# targets formatted as 0, 1, 2, ..., K-1, and sample_weight (of length n) that
# reweights examples in the loss function while training.
# 
# ## Confidence
# 
# There are two new notions of confidence in this package
# 1. Confident examples -- examples we are confident are labeled correctly.
#   We prune everything else. Comptuationally, this means keeping the examples
#   with `high probability of belong to their provided label class'.
# 2. Confident errors -- examples we are confident are labeled incorrectly.
#   We prune these. Comptuationally, this means pruning the examples with
#   `high probability of belong to a different class'.
# 
# ## Example
# 
# ```python
# from cleanlab.classification import LearningWithNoisyLabels
# from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression as LogReg
# 
# rp = LearningWithNoisyLabels(clf=LogReg()) # Pass in any classifier.
# rp.fit(X_train, y_may_have_label_errors)
# Estimate the predictions you would have gotten
#   had you trained without label errors.
# pred = rp.predict(X_test)
# ```
# 
# ## Notes
# 
# * s - denotes *noisy labels*. This is just dataset labels, maybe with errors.
# * Class labels (K classes) must be formatted as natural numbers: 0, 1, .., K-1
#
# ### The easiest way to use any model (Tensorflow, caffe2, PyTorch, etc.)
#   with `cleanlab` is to wrap it in a class that inherets
#   the `sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`:
# ```python
# from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator
# class YourModel(BaseEstimator): # Inherits sklearn base classifier
#     def __init__(self, ):
#         pass
#     def fit(self, X, y, sample_weight = None):
#         pass
#     def predict(self, X):
#         pass
#     def predict_proba(self, X):
#         pass
#     def score(self, X, y, sample_weight = None):
#         pass
# ```

class LearningWithNoisyLabels(BaseEstimator):  # Inherits sklearn classifier
    """Confident Learning is the state-of-the-art (Northcutt et al. 2019) for
      weak supervision, finding label errors in datasets, learning with noisy
      labels, uncertainty estimation, and omre. It works with ANY classifier,
      including deep neural networks. See clf parameter.
    This subfield of machine learning is referred to as Confident Learning.
    Confident Learning also achieves state-of-the-art performance for binary
      classification with noisy labels and positive-unlabeled
      learning (PU learning) where a subset of positive examples is given and
      all other examples are unlabeled and assumed to be negative examples.
    Confident Learning works by "learning from confident examples." Confident
      examples are identified as examples with high predicted probability
      for their training label.
    Given any classifier having the predict_proba() method, an input feature
      matrix, X, and a discrete vector of labels, s, which may contain
      mislabeling, Confident Learning estimates the classifications that would
      be obtained if the hidden, true labels, y, had instead been provided to
      the classifier during training. "s" denotes the noisy label instead of
      \tilde(y), for ASCII encoding reasons.

    Parameters
    ----------
    clf : sklearn.classifier compliant class (e.g. skorch wraps around PyTorch)
      See cleanlab.models for examples of sklearn wrappers around, e.g. PyTorch.
      The clf object must have the following three functions defined:
      1. clf.predict_proba(X) # Predicted probabilities
      2. clf.predict(X) # Predict labels
      3. clf.fit(X, y, sample_weight) # Train classifier
      Stores the classifier used inConfident Learning.
      Default classifier used is logistic regression.

    seed : int (default = None)
      Set the default state of the random number generator used to split
      the cross-validated folds. If None, uses np.random current random state.

    cv_n_folds : int
      This class needs holdout predicted probabilities for every data example
      and if not provided, uses cross-validation to compute them.
      cv_n_folds sets the number of cross-validation folds used to compute
      out-of-sample probabilities for each example in X.

    prune_method : str (default: 'prune_by_noise_rate')
      Available options: 'prune_by_class', 'prune_by_noise_rate', or 'both'.
      This str determines the method used for pruning.
      1. 'prune_by_noise_rate': works by removing examples with
        *high probability* of being mislabeled for every non-diagonal in the
        `prune_counts_matrix` (see pruning.py).
      2. 'prune_by_class': works by removing the examples with *smallest
        probability* of belonging to their given class label for every class.
      3. 'both': Finds the examples satisfying (1) AND (2) and removes their
        set conjunction.

    converge_latent_estimates : bool (Default: False)
      If true, forces numerical consistency of latent estimates. Each is
      estimated independently, but they are related mathematically with closed
      form equivalences. This will iteratively enforce consistency.

    pulearning : int (0 or 1, default: None)
      Only works for 2 class datasets. Set to the integer of the class that is
      perfectly labeled (certain no errors in that class).

    n_jobs : int (Windows users may see a speed-up with n_jobs = 1)
      Number of processing threads used by multiprocessing. Default None
      sets to the number of processing threads on your CPU.
      Set this to 1 to REMOVE parallel processing (if its causing issues)."""

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : np.array
          Input feature matrix (N, D), 2D numpy array

        s : np.array
          A binary vector of labels, s, which may contain mislabeling.

        psx : np.array (shape (N, K))
          P(s=k|x) is a matrix with K (noisy) probabilities for each of the N
          examples x.
          This is the probability distribution over all K classes, for each
          example, regarding whether the example has label s==k P(s=k|x). psx
          should have been computed using 3 (or higher) fold cross-validation.
          If you are not sure, leave psx = None (default) and
          it will be computed for you using cross-validation.

        thresholds : iterable (list or np.array) of shape (K, 1)  or (K,)
          P(s^=k|s=k). List of probabilities used to determine the cutoff
          predicted probability necessary to consider an example as a given
          class label.
          Default is None. These are computed for you automatically.
          If an example has a predicted probability "greater" than
          this threshold, it is counted as having hidden label y = k. This is
          not used for pruning, only for estimating the noise rates using
          confident counts. Values in list should be between 0 and 1.

        noise_matrix : np.array of shape (K, K), K = number of classes
          A conditional probablity matrix of the form P(s=k_s|y=k_y) containing
          the fraction of examples in every class, labeled as every other class.
          Assumes columns of noise_matrix sum to 1.

        inverse_noise_matrix : np.array of shape (K, K), K = number of classes
          A conditional probablity matrix of the form P(y=k_y|s=k_s). Contains
          the estimated fraction observed examples in each class k_s, that are
          mislabeled examples from every other class k_y. If None, the
          inverse_noise_matrix will be computed from psx and s.
